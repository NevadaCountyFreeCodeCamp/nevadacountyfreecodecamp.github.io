 ### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through the `help-wanted` issues:

* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+user%3Anevadacountyfreecodecamp+sort%3Acomments-desc&type=) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.
