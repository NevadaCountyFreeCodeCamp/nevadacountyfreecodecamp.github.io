# Changes since May 30th
Included normalize.css for style reset

Went with Expletus and Raleway fonts as an idea, could be anything else though

Wouldn't mind switching to SCSS and maybe something like bourbon/neat etc to practice something like that if other people are into it. Or not, and stick to basic CSS

The image is by myself from above Bridgeport, if you got something else let me know. I thought I might overlay some code-layer on it in PS.
