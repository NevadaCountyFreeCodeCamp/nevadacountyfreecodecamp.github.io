## update for #9

- using normalize.css now to reset browser styles
- Changed to off-canvas menu on all viewport sizes
- included jQuery and font-awesome
- switched to SCSS and started to declare variables for backgrounds colors etc in _variables.scss
- included social icons at the bottom of the menu
- jQuery logic is now in /js/ui.js
- changed favicon to _official_ freeCodeCamp favicon
- also using a FCC fire icon in the banner image

Let me know what people think, would be nice to collaborate. Also, I don't know much about robots.txt, 404.html etc, things that one uses if it would actually be deployed

### ideas for work
- add text to index.html, start working on Meetings, Talks, Members etc
- some animations, maybe with animate.css or velocity,js
- rotating banner images from Nevada County, should be same ratio though ideally.
- get some better design ideas, change fonts etc
